## About my main projects

  This is my first main project on the C.

  Already it has the documentation.

* ### [freasp](https://github.com/celtrecium/freasp)🐬

  Freaky LISP.  
  This project was started at the end of April 2021.  
  The project was created exclusively for entertainment purposes :P   
  The author doesn't have any theoretical basis for creating programming 
  languages.

## About other projects
  The rest of my projects are simple games that use 
  [codl](https://github.com/celtrecium/codl) library for graphics
